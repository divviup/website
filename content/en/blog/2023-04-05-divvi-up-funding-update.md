excerpt: "Support for ISRG’s newest project, Divvi Up, a service for privacy-preserving metrics"
---

For the last two years, ISRG has been developing Divvi Up and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)'s Distributed Aggregation Protocol [(DAP)](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-ppm-dap-02.html) standard. Funding from Internet Society Foundation and Meta will support our continued progress toward the productionization of this service.

Divvi Up balances wanting to understand metrics about a population of users without infringing upon the privacy of any individual user through the use of cryptography and multi-party computation. Our goal is to be the impetus for a healthy, secure, robust ecosystem for privacy-respecting metrics collection, of which Divvi Up is one player.

Over the last few months, we successfully executed a test of Divvi Up with live data through a deployment with our partners Mozilla and Cloudflare. The test demonstrated that the system operates as expected. We gained insight into how to further optimize for a production-ready service and continue to test and refine the system to ensure it will function at Internet scale.

The next big area of development will be ensuring that Divvi Up is easy to use and leverages automation to pave the path for wide-scale adoption. This will include refining the way subscribers interact with the Divvi Up system to improve ease of use, developing the subscriber sign-up flow on our website, and expanding the available aggregation schemes to provide more options for metrics computations. We will soon begin testing with the [Poplar aggregation scheme](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/017.pdf), which will allow commonly reported values like URLs to be discovered without impinging on the privacy of individual reports.

We're grateful to our funders for supporting the development of this work. If you or your organization want to support privacy-preserving metrics, please get in touch via sponsor@abetterinternet.org.

Divvi Up is a project of the 501(c)3 nonprofit [Internet Security Research Group](https://abetterinternet.org/) (ISRG), the organization behind [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and [Prossimo](https://www.memorysafety.org/).
