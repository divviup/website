<p>
  Our goal is to provide a service that application owners—from government and
  public benefit entities to private companies—can use to easily collect user
  population metrics while respecting user privacy.
</p>

<p>
  Many types of applications, from mobile and desktop apps to websites, generate
  metrics about their users. These metrics are valuable for application owners
  because they are the basis for insights into users’ behavior. Normally an
  application would send all of its metrics back to the app owners, either
  directly or through a middle-entity. Users simply have to trust that owners
  will respect their stated privacy and security policies.
</p>
<p>
  Stated policy, however, is insufficient as a privacy safeguard. Once an app
  owner has user data, privacy policies can be violated either intentionally or
  accidentally. The mere possibility of privacy violations can erode trust in
  applications, making users less likely to want to engage. In addition, the
  presence of personally identifiable information is a liability that more
  organizations are worrying about since it can be unintentionally leaked or
  stolen in a breach.
</p>
<p>
  Divvi Up is a service designed to resolve the tension between wanting to know
  information about a population of users and needing to collect information
  about individuals that might compromise their privacy.
